Although these data structures (and other data structures too!) can be custom-coded in JavaScript, the advanced nature of these topics and the difficulty with implementing related exercises means they are beyond the scope of this reading. 

// Working with arrays in JavaScript
// Previously, you've covered a lot of concepts related to how to work with JavaScript arrays.

// However, there are still a few important topics that can be covered, and one of those is, for example, working with some built-in methods.
