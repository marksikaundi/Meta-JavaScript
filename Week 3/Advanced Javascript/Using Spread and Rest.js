// Using Spread and Rest
// In this reading, you'll learn how to join arrays, objects using the rest operator. You will also discover how to use the spread operator to:

//  Add new members to arrays without using the push() method,

// Convert a string to an array and

// Copy either an object or an array into a separate object

// Recall that the push() and pop() methods are used to add and remove items from the end of an array.
// Join arrays, objects using the rest operator
// Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays
const fruits = ["apple", "pear", "plum"];
const berries = ["blueberry", "strawberry"];
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries]; // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array

//Its also easy to join objects:
const flying = { wings: 2 };
const car = { wheels: 4 };
const flyingCar = { ...flying, ...car };
console.log(flyingCar); // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}

// Add new members to arrays without using the push() method
// Here's how to use the spread operator to easily add one or more members to an existing array:
let veggies = ["onion", "parsley"];
veggies = [...veggies, "carrot", "beetroot"];
console.log(veggies);

// Convert a string to an array using the spread operator
// Given a string, it's easy to spread it out into separate array items:
const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

//Copy either an object or an array into a separate one
//Here's how to copy an object into a completely separate object, using the spread operator.

const car1 = {
  speed: 200,
  color: "yellow",
};
//const car 2 = {...car1}

car1.speed = 201;

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed);
